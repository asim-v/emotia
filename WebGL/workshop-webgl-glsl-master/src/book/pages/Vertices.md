So now we know what a 3D coordinate is: `(x, y, z)`.

Within this workshop, let's consider a *vertex* (plural: vertices) as a 3D coordinate that holds some data, like `position`, `color`, and other attributes.

Here we have three vertices in a 3D space, each with different `position` and `color` attributes.
