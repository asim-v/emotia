Often when we talk of *Cartesian Coordinates*, the **origin point** `(0, 0)` is in the centre, and the coordinates can be negative or positive.

This will be important as we shift to 3D coordinates. Instead of thinking of "top left" we should begin to think of "relative to the origin point `(0, 0)`."
