# Welcome

This is the interactive guidebook for a workshop on WebGL and GLSL.

We'll be using the following tools:

- [canvas-sketch](https://github.com/mattdesl/canvas-sketch/) for exporting prints & animations
- [Glitch.com](https://glitch.com/) for collecting and demoing some online and easily editable examples
